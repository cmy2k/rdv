  description: "
           A day’s highest (maximum) temperature usually occurs in the afternoon. Averaging the daily high temperatures over any period results in a mean maximum temperature for that period.
        <br />
        <br />
        Maximum temperature serves as one measure of comfort and safety for people and for the health of plants and animals. When maximum temperature exceeds particular thresholds, people can become ill and transportation and energy infrastructure may be stressed."

           A day’s lowest (minimum) temperature usually occurs in the early morning, just before sunrise. Averaging the daily low temperatures for any period results in a mean minimum temperature for that period.
        <br />
        <br />
        Periods of low temperature give plants, animals, and people a chance to recover from daytime heat. When minimum temperatures aren’t sufficiently cool, plant and animal responses can trigger ecosystem changes and increased demand for energy can stress energy infrastructure."

           The total number of days per year when the highest temperature is less than 32°F (0°C) is an indicator of how often very cold days occur.
        <br />
        <br />
        Days when the highest temperature doesn't rise above the freezing point of water are called “icing days.” The annual number of icing days tells us how much rest plants get from growing; with too few icing days, some plants do not perceive a “reset” signal to begin budding or blooming in the spring. The annual number of icing days can also help predict if populations of insects, such as tree-killing bark beetles, will survive the winter or not."

    <strong>Days per year with Minimum Temperature below 32°F </strong><hr/>
    The total number of days per year when the temperature dips below 32°F (0°C) is an indicator of how often cold days occur.
    <br />
    <br />
    A decrease in the number of days temperature drops below freezing promotes earlier spring snowmelt and runoff, with important consequences for managing water resources. Below-freezing temperatures can cause driving hazards, aircraft icing, and damage to infrastructure, yet ski resorts and other winter recreation businesses depend on sufficiently cold days to maintain snowpack. Some plants require a cumulative number of days below freezing before they can begin budding or blooming in the spring."

  label: "Heating Degree Days"
  description: "
           The number of heating degree days at any location reflects the amount of energy people use to heat a building when it is cool outside. Lower numbers of heating degree days indicate lower demand for energy.
        <br />
        <br />
        Heating degree days measure how much (in degrees), and for how long (in days), outside air temperature is below 65°F. For example, on a day when the average outdoor temperature is 35°F, raising the indoor temperature to 65°F would require 30 degrees of heating multiplied by 1 day, or 30 heating degree days. Engineers and utility companies use a location's annual number of heating degree days as one input when estimating demand for energy in the cold season."

  description: "
           The number of cooling degree days at any location reflects the amount of energy people use to cool a building when it is warm outside. Higher numbers of cooling degree days indicate higher demand for energy.
        <br />
        <br />
        Cooling degree days measure how much (in degrees), and for how long (in days), outside air temperature is higher than 65°F. For example, on a day when the average outdoor temperature is 85°F, reducing the indoor temperature to 65°F would require 20 degrees of cooling multiplied by 1 day, or 20 cooling degree days. Engineers and utility companies use a location's annual number of cooling degree days as one input when estimating demand for energy in the warm season."

  label: "Growing Degree Days"
  description: "
           The number of growing degree days per year is used to estimate the growth and development of plants (or insects) during the growing season. Higher numbers of growing-degree days indicate longer and warmer growing conditions.
        <br />
        <br />
        As growth occurs only when temperature exceeds a species' base temperature (for example, 50°F), the number of days times the number of degrees above the base indicates the duration and magnitude of growing conditions."

  description: "
           Corn growers use the number of modified growing degree days to monitor the development of corn crops.
        <br />
        <br />
        As corn development occurs only when temperature is above 50°F but below 86°F, the standard calculation for growing-degree days is modified to omit conditions outside this range. In future decades, regions where temperatures regularly exceed 86°F may be less successful in growing corn."

  label: "Thawing Degree Days"
  description: "
           In late winter and early spring, thawing degree-days are used to monitor the average number of degrees above freezing <u>combined with</u> how long it is above freezing.
        <br />
        <br />
        Projected increases in thawing degree days reflect warmer above-freezing temperatures (for example, 45°F rather than 40°F) and/or shorter durations of above-freezing temperatures.
        <br />
        <br />
        The cumulative number of thawing degree days for a period can be calculated by taking the average number of degrees above freezing times the number of days in the period. For example, with an average temperature of 42°F (10°F above freezing) for one week, 10°F x 7 days = 70 thawing degree days."

  description: "
           Freezing degree days measure how far below freezing it is <u>combined with</u> how long it remains below freezing.
        <br />
        <br />
        Projected decreases in freezing degree-days reflect warmer below-freezing temperatures (for example, -10°F rather than -20°F) and/or shorter durations of below-freezing temperatures. Values for freezing degree-days are used to estimate ice growth on lakes and the sea.
        <br />
        <br />
        Cumulative freezing degree days for a period can be calculated by taking the average number of degrees below freezing times the number of days in the period. For example, with an average temperature of 12°F (20°F below freezing) over one week, a location would accumulate (20°F x 7 days) or 140 freezing degree days."
